  I am experienced Human Resource Management Professional with solid business studies background. I'm working in Office of Planning and Development in a private university these day. The purpose of making this blog is to let people know how I have been involved in different HR developmental activities, how I perceive the usefulness of these activities and reviews of various articles.
