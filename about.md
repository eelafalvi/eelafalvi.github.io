  I am experienced human resource management professional with solid business studies background. I've been working in Office of Planning and Development in a private university these day as an Officer Training & Deevelopment. The purpose of making this blog is to let people know how I have been involved in different HR developmental activities, how I perceive the usefulness of these activities and reviews of various articles.
